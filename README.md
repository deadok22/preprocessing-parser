Preprocessing parser
====================

Extensive preprocessor usage in various languages requires language tools, such as code browsers, refactoring tools, inspection tools and IDEs, to work with unpreprocessed code. Unpreprocessed code can be viewed as a mix of two languages - a preprocessor language and a language itself. Preprocessor features usually include macro processing, conditional compilation and file inclusion.

This project is a tool which allows for parsing of unpreprocessed code using preprocessor language parser, language lexer and language grammar.

This project is developed as part of my Master's thesis work at [St.Petersburg Academic University](http://www.spbau.ru/main_eng/info_main_eng).
